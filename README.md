## Project Description<a name="motivation"></a>

This project is a part of the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree Program. In this project, unsupervised learning techniques were applied to identify segments of the customer which form the core customer based for a mail-order sales company based in Germany.

Using data preprocessing, cleaning and data science techniques, these segments can be used for marketing purposes and campaigns.


## Results<a name="results"></a>

For Clusters 3, 4, 6 and 8, we can observe a great amount of overrepresentation.

In contrast to that, in Clusters 1, 2, 9, 11 and 12, we can observe a decent amount of overrepresentation.

The popular segments are people from age groups 46 to 60, with health type of jaunty hedonists and high income.

The unpopular segments are people with very high religion and high income factors.
