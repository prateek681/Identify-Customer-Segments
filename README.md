## Project Description<a name="motivation"></a>

This project is a part of the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree Program. In this project, unsupervised learning techniques were applied to identify segments of the customer which form the core customer based for a mail-order sales company based in Germany.

Using data preprocessing, cleaning and data science techniques, these segments can be used for marketing purposes and campaigns.

Cluster 4 is overrepresented in the customers data compared to general population data. Some characteristics of the group of population that are relative popular with the mail-order company:

* in areas where the share of 6-10 family homes is lower (PLZ8_ANTG3=1.73)
* in Prosperous or Comfortable households (WEALTH=2.75)
* in life stage of Families With School Age Children or Older Families & Mature Couples (LIFE_STAGE=3.30)

Cluster 13 is underrepresented in the customers data. Some characteristics of the segment of the population that are relatively unpopular with the company:

* in areas where the share of 6-10 family homes is higher (PLZ8_ANTG3=2.44)
